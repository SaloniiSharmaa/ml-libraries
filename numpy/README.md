# NumPy — Core Numerical Computing Foundations

This folder contains structured experiments and code snippets created while
learning **NumPy**, with an emphasis on *how and why* NumPy works rather than
surface-level syntax.

The focus is on building intuition for array-based computation, memory layout,
and vectorized thinking — skills that directly translate to data science,
machine learning, and scientific computing workflows.

## What’s covered
- Creation and manipulation of 1D, 2D, and n-dimensional arrays  
- Array indexing, slicing, boolean masking, and fancy indexing  
- Shape manipulation: reshape, transpose, flatten, stacking, splitting  
- Vectorized computations for performance-efficient numerical operations  
- Broadcasting rules and real use cases  
- Universal functions (ufuncs) and element-wise operations  
- Basic linear algebra: dot product, matrix operations, norms  
- Statistical operations: mean, variance, standard deviation  
- Working with random numbers and reproducibility  

## Purpose
NumPy is foundational to data science and machine learning libraries such as Pandas, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.  
This repo focuses on building strong fundamentals before moving into higher-level ML tools.

## Tech
- Python
- NumPy

## Current Status
This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a production library.
Concepts are revisited and refined as understanding improves.

Future additions may include:
- Memory layout experiments
- Strides and views
- Numerical precision edge cases
