# Pandas — Data Manipulation & Analysis Foundations


This repository showcases my practical use of Pandas for real-world data handling, analysis, and preprocessing — the core skills required before applying machine learning models.

## What’s covered
- Loading and exporting data from common formats (CSV, Excel, JSON)
- Inspecting datasets for structure, types, and data quality issues
- Selecting, filtering, and transforming data using idiomatic Pandas workflows
- Cleaning messy data: missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats
- Feature preparation: type casting, encoding-ready transformations
- Groupby operations for aggregation, summarization, and pattern discovery
- Merging, joining, and concatenating datasets across multiple keys
- Working with time-series data: parsing, indexing, resampling
- Efficient use of vectorized operations over loops
- Applying functions with apply, map, and lambda expressions
- Building reproducible exploratory data analysis (EDA) pipelines
- Preparing clean, model-ready datasets for downstream ML tasks
  

## Learning approach
I focus on:
- Understanding *why* each operation is used
- Writing readable, maintainable data pipelines
- Avoiding shortcuts that break at scale



## Tech
- Python
- Pandas

## How This Folder Is Organized
- Each file or notebook focuses on **one core concept**
- Experiments are small, reproducible, and isolated
- Code prioritizes clarity and correctness over clever tricks
- Comments explain *why* operations behave the way they do

---

## Why This Matters for ML & Data Science
Pandas is the primary interface for:
- data ingestion
- cleaning and transformation
- feature preparation

A solid understanding of Pandas reduces friction when working with:
- scikit-learn
- visualization libraries
- real-world datasets that are imperfect by default

## Current Status
This is a **learning-focused repository**, not a production codebase.
Concepts are revisited and refined as understanding deepens.

Future additions may include:
- performance considerations
- memory usage patterns
- common anti-patterns in Pandas workflows
